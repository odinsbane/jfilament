# jfilament
JFilament is an ImageJ plugin for segmentation and tracking of 2D and 3D filaments in fluorescenece microscopy images. The main algorithm used in Jfilament is "Stretching Open Active Contours".

This site has the source code of the project. For a compiled version and for user instructions go to http://athena.physics.lehigh.edu/jfilament.

This work is supported by NIH and by the Biosystems Dynamics Summer Institute at Lehigh University.
